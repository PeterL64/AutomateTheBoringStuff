# We will define a Function called PlusOne with a Parameter(variable) called
# number.
# And we will have a Return statement where it will return
# the variable "number" + 1.

# We can call the Function, "PlusOne", and assign the Variable, "number", the
# integer value 5, and the Function will Return 5 + 1, which is 6, which is a
# value.

# We stored the value(actual number) PlusOne(5) under the Variable NewNumber
# Then we will print the Variable NewNumber,(like printing x),
