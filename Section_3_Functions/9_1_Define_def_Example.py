def hello():            # Define this new function called hello
    print ('Hello!')    # Code inside the new function we created
    print('Hello!!!!!')
    print('hello')

hello()                 # We will call this function three times.
hello()                 # When you call the eg print function you can pass in
hello()                 # values called arguements between the parenthesis. We
                        # did not in this example.

# Without the function, we would need to copy and paste the print statements
# three times instead of calling the function three times.
