# Augmented Assignment Operators


# A frequent thing to do with a variable is to use the variable itself
# to increment its value. eg:
spam = 42
spam = spam + 1
spam
#Returns 43

# A shortcut for this using Augmented Operators is
spam = 42
spam += 1
spam
#Returns 43

# There are Augmented operators for plus, minus, multiplication, division, and
# the modulus operators.
# Table below shows these:

# Augmented Assignment Statement        # Equivalent Assignment Statement
# spam += 1                             # spam = spam + 1
# spam -= 1                             # spam = spam - 1
# spam *= 1                             # spam = spam * 1
# spam /= 1                             # spam = spam / 1
# spam %= 1                             # spam = spam % 1
